## Overview of the project and its purpose

Climate change has intensified droughts in Mexico, and the recurrence of those events has increased since 2021.

Monterrey is Mexico’s largest city and one of its economic centers. In 2022, the New York Times reported up to 75 days of water shortages in Monterrey. 
Due to drought, there was also a tough water crisis in Monterrey, Nuevo León, in 2024. The situation was critical, and precautionary measures must be taken to avoid further shortages.

Given the historic water supply crisis in the state of Nuevo León, the population needs to know where to consult the points, schedules, and contacts where assistance is provided for distributing water. Therefore, this water supply dataset allows the population to visualize key water supply spots.

In general, there is a challenge in the water management in Monterrey, therefore, in this project, we will create a series of data visualizations to show the data in different ways. 

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
We work with jupyter, HTML, Json, geojson.io, SQL
n this work you can see the information of the index, the codes with the HTML, interactive maps on the schedules of water supply by neighborhoods, as well as the water supply points either by pipe or other means, we can see a map with graphs where it mentions the locations and water levels of the main dams in Monterrey, as well as the places in which the water is supplied to the main water supply points, as well as the places where the water is supplied.
we have an interactive page where you can see an overview of some of the main maps: 
[Monterrey Supplied Points and Dams](https://lord-byront.github.io/dataviz-water-supply-Mty/)

We can also check the dams which are used to supply water to Monterrey and if they supply it to a specific location by using [Geojson web app](https://geojson.io/#map=7.35/25.641/-99.787/108.8). The code to display the map would be the [geojson file]() inside the "dams" folder.

## Efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
It was important to analyze the information avoiding biases and looking for ways to raise awareness through government pages considering that the information reflects situations in which we are involved as citizens of Monterrey.
