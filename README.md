# Water supply points at the municipal level: Monterrey
* By Dariana Ibarra, Byront Urcid, David Ruvalcaba, Karla Flores 

## Rationale

Climate change has intensified droughts in Mexico, and the recurrence of those events has increased since 2021.

Monterrey is Mexico’s largest city and one of the economic centers of Mexico. In 2022, the NY Times reported that in Monterrey there were places where there was up to 75 days of water shortage. In 2024 there was also a tough water crisis in Monterrey, Nuevo León, due to drought. The situation was critical and precautionary measures must be taken to avoid further shortages.

Given the historic water supply crisis in the state of Nuevo León, the population needs to have information on where to consult the points, schedules, and contacts where assistance is provided for distributing water. Therefore, this water supply dataset allows the population to visualize key water supply spots.

In general, there is a challenge in the management of water in Monterrey, therefore, in this project, we will create a series of data visualizations to show the data in different ways.
