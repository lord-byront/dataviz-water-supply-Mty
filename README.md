## Overview of the project and its purpose

Climate change has intensified droughts in Mexico, and the recurrence of those events has increased since 2021.

Monterrey is Mexico’s largest city and one of its economic centers. In 2022, the New York Times reported up to 75 days of water shortages in Monterrey. 
Due to drought, there was also a tough water crisis in Monterrey, Nuevo León, in 2024. The situation was critical, and precautionary measures must be taken to avoid further shortages.

Given the historic water supply crisis in the state of Nuevo León, the population needs to know where to consult the points, schedules, and contacts where assistance is provided for distributing water. Therefore, this water supply dataset allows the population to visualize key water supply spots.

In general, there is a challenge in the water management in Monterrey, therefore, in this project, we will create a series of data visualizations to show the data in different ways.
